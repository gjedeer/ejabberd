The thing that always annoyed me in ejabberd when compared to, 
say, google talk, was that when I started a conversation on one
device, it routed all subsequent messages to this device.

So I made it behave as if resources did not exist. It sends 
incoming messages to all connected resources with non-negative
priority.

This is a branch of 2.1.x line.

Also, please note that this is an one evening hack and I don't
know any erlang ;)
